## Disclaimer
This document MUST not be read in any way that applies to any other manager from other departments, groups, divisions, or teams of Jack Henry.  
You will find my document close to those you encounter online and sometimes a copy & paste, and that's OK. It just means I couldn't put it in better words.  
This document is a living document.  
If you find my beliefs, style, and ways of working are not wholly aligned with what you observe in Jack Henry, that's OK. I'll be learning and evolving my views and ways of working with the sole intent of serving you and Jack Henry best.  
I'm pleased to work with you at Jack Henry, where I hope it becomes a place where you'll grow, develop, contribute, and enjoy your professional hours. I'm also hopeful that the journey gets easier with your fresh ideas and enthusiasm.  
I look forward to working with you. Welcome to the team!

## Motivations Behind This Document
Having been inspired by several documents/posts on the importance of a Manager's README, I've decided to kick things off on Github with my own edition. A few reasons for this document to exist:
- Writing and maintaining this document helps me refine my thoughts and hold myself accountable.
- To share some of my expectations of you and me.
- Establish guiding principles to enable you to do your job efficiently, effectively, and with confidence.
- For you to help me improve and hold me accountable.
- Lay down the foundation for a symbiotic relationship between us that helps us grow together.

**Important**: This document is NOT meant as a replacement for us getting to know each other! We'll learn more about each other over time.

## Hi, I'm LZ!
I'm originally from Cleveland, recently from Buffalo, and currently in the suburbs of Chicago! I started in software in 2006 at a company that started doing online course evaluations in their sales/marketing support areas, and as they grew into college admissions, I grew my career into Quality Assurance and into management. I enjoy walking the lines between engineering and stakeholders (the engineers can't talk to the people!) and helping individuals grow personally and professionally. If you report to me, I'm here for the long term!

I am married to my husband Jake (15 years), and we have two boys, Casey (11) and Maxwell (7). In my spare time, I love being on my kayak and baking.

Some nice things hailed to me are: "firm but friendly".

### Things you will hear me say, a lot:
- "Do what you gotta do to be successful".
- “I will inform and advise”.

### I have very little patience for:
- Apathy and indifference. If something is going on, let me know ASAP.
- BS and toxic culture.

### Things I know about but am working on:
- My communication skills fade out as I get tired.
- My face sometimes looks very serious.
- I tend to be a bit verbose. I know it is annoying. Please call it out.
- I'm heavily biased towards action. There's value in having strategic discussions, but most of the time is best to start with small and quick iterations. This way, we can prove (or not) our assumptions (fail-fast to learn-fast) and make visible progress. Actions speak louder than words.

## My Job
As an Engineering Manager, my job is to:
- Foster a cohesive team and a healthy culture founded on world-class talent, kindness, candor, learn-it-all mindset, operational excellence, and customer centricity.
- Attract and retain world-class talent. That's you.
- Assure the growth and development of individuals and teams.
- Represent our team up and out.
- Help Jack Henry with processes and structure so that we have a scalable, effective, and efficient organization.
- Influence decisions.
- Set context and expected business outcomes so that everyone can connect the dots on what Jack Henry needs, understand why/what the priorities are, and what needs to get done.
- Foster and nurture ownership, whereby everyone is a business owner by developing guiding principles to simplify and decentralize decision-making.
- Help people to develop secondary relationships.
- Help to develop Jack Henry's Engineering brand.
- Assure we're all delivering business value that meets or exceeds Jack Henry's goals.
- Create more leaders, not more followers, while setting these leaders up to succeed.

## What a Great Culture Looks Like to Me
- A commercially sustainable people-first culture.
- A diverse and inclusive culture.
- We have a strong sense of ownership and belonging.
- We stay honest to the company vision, mission, and core values at all times.
- We have a growth and learn-it-all mindset. We're curious, not judgmental!
- We set high standards and continuously seek to raise the bar.
- We're kind and candid.
- We expect excellence in ourselves first and then in others.
- We are proud of who we are and what we do.
- We create impact at pace. We focus on outcomes, not on outputs!
- We have fun together.

## General Guiding Principles
- Integrity, honesty, and authenticity are never up for discussion.
- You work for Jack Henry, not for me, and I serve you, not the other way around.
- We're a team, one team. Our behaviors are conducive to a cohesive, effective, and efficient team.
- We assume the best intentions in everyone until proven otherwise. We set lean and humane checks & balances to ensure cultural deviations don't go unacknowledged.
- We're biased towards transparency. Anyone can ask us anything and often will get an answer. Sometimes we can't disclose information, but we're committed to never lie.
- We have a strong bias for action. We thrive on getting meaningful work done (AKA impact).
- We first expect excellence from ourselves and only then from others, but we hold each other's backs at all times. Along the way, we make mistakes, but we're committed to taking accountability and learning from our mistakes.
- We embrace that management is not leadership. Both are equally important but not mutually exclusive or dependent. In an oversimplification fashion:
  - Management is about working with objectives; responsible for the quality, processes, staffing, and retaining talent; and deliverables. It's a position in the company.
  - Leadership is about working with goals and vision; and inspiring people towards a goal. Leadership comes from everywhere.

## We Think About Impact
- **Consistency**: Are you able to deliver work that matters not just once but does so sustainably over time?
- **Velocity**: What's the rate at which you deliver impact, not just the cumulative impact you have achieved.
- **Ownership**: Think long term and take ownership of what and how you deliver impact in line with Jack Henry's objectives.
- **Accountability**: Everyone is accountable for delivering impact. More senior levels are held more directly accountable for the business impact of their decisions and actions.
- **Materiality**: You deliver what you said you would deliver by the time you committed to deliver it.
- **Force Multipliers**: Individually, we're accountable for impact, but what would happen if you actively help your wider team create impact? What happens when we radiate positivity?

## How I Aspire to Manage
**Progress Over Perfection!**

### The Model that I Follow
- **Be a role model**: Your behaviors matter to everyone around you. Model the behavior you expect from others. If you want to effect change, you must often adjust yourself to embody the change you wish to make.
- **Be a coach**: It all starts by actively listening! Then help individuals and teams to gain self-awareness and self-reflection; set and clarify objectives; achieve their development objectives; unlock their potential; act as a sounding board. The coach's job is to ensure individuals and teams thrive and grow.
- **Be one that cares**: Nothing really matters if people don't feel that you deeply care about their growth, success, and them as human beings. By deeply caring, you'll be fostering a strong sense of belonging, a holistic sense of ownership, and ultimately loyalty. Others come first, or in other words, we eat last!
- **Think global, act locally**: Think in systems, a company is not a sum of all parts but the product of its interactions! We need everyone from everywhere in Jack Henry to be successful. A problem anywhere is a shared problem, and a win anywhere is a shared win!

**Remember**: We run companies, manage processes and things, and lead people!

## Management Guiding Principles
- Our #1 priority is our people. We'll always find time to attract, retain, coach, and lead our people while continually raising the bar, even when it is uncomfortable. We take it as an article of faith that it is the right decision long-term.
- Customers are at the front and center of everything we do.
- We grow with people. There is always room for growth, and we seek it relentlessly. Feedback is our most valuable and effective tool to keep raising the bar on everything we do. We deliver and receive feedback kindly, promptly, with empathy, and candor.
- Processes exist to serve us. We continually review its fit for purpose and ways to improve. A customer must never experience a degraded service while waiting for our processes to complete.
- We take accountability for anything that goes wrong in our team, even if we're not involved in the issue.

## How Do I Measure the Success of Our Team
- Team health and everyone's well-being is high.
- Customer's quantitative and qualitative feedback about the software we ship is positive.
- We're strong contributors to Jack Henry's objectives/goals.

## How Am I Going to Review Your Performance
- You foster a diverse and inclusive team environment where everyone has a strong sense of belonging.
- You're productive and results-oriented.
- You're a good communicator within the team.
- You collaborate effectively across Jack Henry.
- You're a reliable decision-maker.
- You're a willing learner and seek to improve yourself.
- You're a team player that develops productive and meaningful relationships at all levels.

## My Ideal Team
- Has a strong sense of belonging.
- Takes control of, and responsibility for, our own destiny in alignment with Jack Henry’s objectives.
- Has each other's back.
- Holds each other accountable.
- Expects excellence in themselves and then in others.
- Is curious, not judgmental.
- Maintains a high level of transparency at all times.
- Constantly learns.
- Laughs together.
- Creates long-lasting impact at pace.

## Me as a Resource
Be clear about what you need from me for your success — the role, comp, org change, more feedback, more context, etc.  
Be clear when you need the company's resources. Be data-driven about why you need it, gather alignment from the pertinent stakeholders, and show that you're cost-conscious. I like justifications that include, "this is what [company we respect] does" + "this is the ROI" + "this is what an experiment would cost, and if it works, from there, I can shut it down or scale it up" + "this is the most cost-effective solution for these reasons."  
I love to work through problems together if it's helpful to you.

## How Do I Think About Trust
Trust and developing trust is a vast topic. Still, I broadly think about trust in the terms:
- **Empathy**: Others’ success comes first. Others will not trust you if it is thought that you care more about yourself than about them.
- **Logic**: If it doesn't make sense or lacks rigor, chances are others will not trust your judgment.
- **Authenticity**: If others feel they're not getting access to the "real" you — to a full and complete accounting of what you know, think, and feel — chances are they will not feel safe around you and therefore not trust you.
- **Execution**: If you don’t walk the talk, meaning you are not dependable, chances are others will not trust you.

## Communication
Communication is key to everything that we do. It's the cornerstone of trust, and trust is the bedrock of everything we do. It will make or break us. I don't claim to be an expert, but below I'll do my very best to describe what works for me. It's not a definite guide.
- I strive to have an open-door policy. With the remote culture, I check in with my team because I've found the hard way that the vast majority of issues result from poor or infrequent communication. We must communicate well and often.
- Communicate conscientiously. Communicate kindly, clearly, concisely, and get straight to the point (I'm working hard on these). Value people's time, and they will value yours.
- Empathy goes a long way, and often one doesn't know people's constraints, feelings, and commitments before having a candid and compassionate conversation about it. Don't assume, have a conversation instead.
- Share information openly, broadly, and deliberately.

Nothing to hide. Feel free to discuss things with anybody in the company, from C-levels to everyone else. However, if you are unsure if you should share something, ask before sharing. Failing to do so could have a net negative impact on trust.

If something is wrong, I appreciate hearing it from you so we can fix it together. Failure to address issues first with me will bring us both a great deal of pain because I perceive it as toxic office politics.  
Over-communicate when you can, so that you earn credits for when you're unusually busy. If people start getting overwhelmed by the quantity, they will tell you.  
Intentionally create/use communication in the right forums to share information.  
Be as data-centric as possible. There's less room for interpretation, and emotions tend not to get in the way.  
Use your business acumen. Communication goes a long way when people can relate with a solid narrative that's solving a problem.

### Optimize for Data/Facts/Knowledge-Based Communication
- It's perfectly acceptable to share opinions. I like to ‘Inform and Advise’. But it's important to be explicit when you're giving your opinion versus making a statement of fact, "IMO" vs "evidence shows". This will help the audience put your remarks in perspective, and you'll be giving a positive contribution to the group.
- I tend to ask for your thoughts rather than opinions because I value the understanding of your thought process more.

### Words Matter
Communication tends to be vague, verbose, and non-committal. This often leads to misunderstandings that can erode trust, cause inefficiencies, and ultimately build resentment. We must work hard to avoid it!  
Use words people understand; avoid using acronyms; be concise and straight to the point; be specific with the language you use.

Some examples of words that one should work hard to avoid using: "may", "might", "could", "can", "can be", "virtually", "up to", "as much as", "help", "like", "believe", "possibly", "endeavors", "aims to", "try", "some", "many", "most", "almost all", "often", "I think", "I reckon", "probably" and similar qualifiers that create enough wiggle room for interpretation.  
**NOTE**: These examples don't apply to this document because it's supposed to reference how to work with me.

## Feedback
Feedback is a reaction or information from someone that occurs due to actions or behavior undertaken by an individual or group. A gift with the power to skyrocket an organization to new heights. It unleashes growth, innovation, problem-solving, engagement and creates empowerment across the board. The objective of feedback is solely to help people grow, live up to their potential, and interact more effectively with colleagues.

Feedback is critical to our success, and I love it.  
Let me know if I don't do well.  
I'll let you know if you don't.  
Performance reviews should never be a surprise for you. If it is, let me know.  
Feedback must be given often and immediately.  
Please tell me how you prefer to receive feedback. If not, I'll ask you how you prefer to receive feedback. I like to receive feedback: promptly, objectively, directly, with specifics and actionable items.

## Get a Hold of Me
I’m pretty easy to get a hold of. I will always make myself available if you need me.

### Some Tips that Can Help You Get a Hold of Me
- **Emergency**: find me -> call me -> text me -> slack me -> drop me an email. Do whatever you need to do to get a hold of me.
- **Urgent matter**: text me -> slack me -> drop me an email.
- **Important matter**: slack me -> drop me an email.
- If you would like a meeting or discussion, initiate finding time in my calendar and make the appointment. If I suggest a discussion, I will do the same. Don't say "let's discuss" without a quick follow-up of when we'll discuss.

## Meetings
### Daily Standups
Daily standups occur (you guessed it) daily at 10:30am CST with an average duration of 15 minutes with my direct reports in a team setting. We meet via Slack in an informal huddle setting. It helps the team navigate our day, and is imperative to the success of staying accountable. It's also a forum where team members:
- Have an opportunity to see work updates and move tickets to completion together.
- Identify blockers in getting work done.
- Get to know what's going on with each other, bounce ideas, and offer help.
- Ensure we're aligned at all times.
- Nurture team cohesion.

### Team Demo/Retros
The below format is a blueprint. All team members must be prepared for the meeting to actively and assertively contribute. Time is a scarce resource for us all. Attending and participating it's a moral duty to your teammates and a formal duty to me.
- **Team Demos (30 min)**: We review as a team the content going out in a release.
- **Team Retros (60 min)**: We review the previous Retro's action items, talk about items using the Keep Doing, Stop Doing, format. We'll also keep retros open until ALL action items are closed.
- **Team Members Round (30 min)**: Each team member will share impact, disappointments, issues/concerns for visibility, escalation/help needed, and learnings. What's hot on their plate? What's the plan for the week? Usually is just to highlight some points on the Flash Reports and let the team make questions or offer help.

### Team Planning
- Review team assignments/actions progress (5 min).
- Review of the Roadmap.
- Review of the Backlog/Up Next (10 minutes).
- Deep dives / swarming (30 min to 1 hour): Discussion about problem-solving or new initiatives. This time can also be used to discuss strategy.
- Review action items.

### 1:1s
Our 1:1s are scheduled at your duration and convenience. I like using 1:1s to check in on how you're doing, what you need from me, personnel issues, your professional development and performance reviews. I also use 1:1s for strategy questions that we can seed/discuss and provide any missing context and bi-directional feedback. These are also forums for you to seek advice.  
Once a quarter, we will formally document performance.

#### Pro tips:
- Start from where you left off.
- Prepare your topics in advance.
- Don't expect me to have everything figured out or solve the problems for you. I'm here to help you find a way forward.

### Note on Career Development
Your career is yours, not mine. You know best how you'd like to grow and in what areas. I can provide feedback, be a soundboard, help you self-reflect, help set objectives, provide guidance and tools, etc. I'll do my best to offer growth opportunities, but it's up to you to seize them.

## What to Do When You Get a Message From Me
I don't expect you to respond to everything in real-time, but I expect you to close the loop on everything we open in a timely manner. If it's on my plate, I will do the same. I get frustrated when I have to ask about something twice or ask about something that we've agreed you should have come back to me with.  
I like fast turnaround and acknowledgement on written communications like a "got it" or "on it" type acknowledgement, so I know things we're discussing are moving.  
I tend to send FYIs to keep you in the loop. Unless you have a simple question that can't be discussed on other forums, there's no need to reply.  
If you're CC'ed, I'm not expecting you to reply, but it's perfectly acceptable that you choose to do so. Just be conscious that you're jumping on someone else's conversation.

## Decision-Making Guide
I expect you to make decisions all the time as independently as possible and be right often. I expect you to ask for help or advice when you're not sure, or you could use a soundboard. You are not alone. I'm here for you.

### Decision-Making Reasoning
Reasoning is using data, facts, and a formal process to decide about possible courses of action. We move fast, but the world is complex, ambiguous and unpredictable. More often than not, we can't wait to have all the information available to make a decision. We need between 50% to 70% of the information to decide. Still, we must be excellent at correcting courses and learning.

I tend to optimize for:
- What's the best for the customer/our people today, mid and long-term? "What does 'good' look like" so I have a reference point to evaluate other options. If you don't know what you want without constraints, how the heck will you know in the face of constraints? Note that today's solution is often tomorrow's problem (System Thinking)!
- What's the cost of delay in making the decision?
- Can it be reversed? Will it open other possibilities in the future? How? When? Are we going to learn something new?

### Decision-Making Intuition
Intuition is using one’s gut feeling to decide about possible courses of action. Although some people perceive it as a sixth sense only available to some, IMHO, intuition combines past experience and personal values. It is worth taking intuition into account because it reflects your learnings. It is, however, not always based on reality, only perceptions.  
It's perfectly acceptable to use your intuition to make a decision that's simple in nature or needs to be made quickly. It's also perfectly acceptable to use intuition to close the gap between knowns and unknowns and question what the data suggests (e.g., are we asking the right questions?). When your intuition is fronting the facts, try hard to validate it.

### Deliberately Not Making a Decision is Also Valid
Deciding to not decide is also a sound decision when it is deliberate. Not making a decision might feel unnatural or even wrong. It's a valid course of action as any other, and it must always be on the table.

### Decision-Making Process
I expect you to align with the following decision-making process:
1. Start from nothing!
2. State the problem, assumptions, constraints, and dependencies.
3. Define what ‘good’ looks like and how to measure it so that one has a reference point. Define what options are available using data and facts:
   - Rank the options, e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold.
   - Be specific and clear on the pros/cons and the risks/mitigations for each variant. Define the success criteria for each option (How does success look like? What does failure look like?).
   - Define rollout, e.g., experiment, kill-switch, how to scale-up, etc.
   - Anticipate the questions of the stakeholders.
4. Keep yourself in check. Use your critical thinking, and don't let your ego/emotions get in the way.
5. Make a decision!

### Roadblocks and Escalation
Let me know when you bump into a roadblock that you can't solve or something needs approval from Leadership. I'll work with you. Don't get hung up on "process", upcoming meetings, and such. Just-in-time escalation is usually more efficient.

### When the Decision It's Not Yours to Make, or You Weren't Included, or You Simply Disagree with the Decision
If you genuinely agree with the decision, happy days. Join forces and let's get it done. It is, however, harder to buy into a decision that you don't agree with and/or you weren't consulted on. While I'll always try to include you, decisions must happen at the right level. The right level is dictated by the Jack Henry structure and processes. Sometimes life just happens. The world is not perfect. Note that I'll not be looking for consensus at all costs.

You're expected to:
- Provide clear and factual-based arguments why you disagree with the decision on the right forum.
- Come up with realistic alternatives.
- If the decision hasn't budged, Disagree and Commit. Stand by it and give your best to make it a success. Be a team player.

We all have those moments where we have a gut reaction "I don't like this", "It doesn't make sense whatsoever", "this is wrong", etc. Pace yourself! Know your position first; don't just say 'no' and expect others to try to convince you. Start by completing the sentence: "I [don't agree with/don't think we should do/don't like] X because…". If it doesn't sound strong enough or right, it usually is because it's not. Think a bit more, take it off-line, and come back later with good arguments.

## Cheers!
You made it to the end! Spoiler alert! My last name is pronounced S-M-I-T-H.
